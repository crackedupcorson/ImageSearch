# ImageSearch
Upload an image. Give an estimated location. Find a city.
Currently it uses flickr as a data source to find geotagged images that match the search criteria.
It then does a comparison to find the most likely and return some to the user.


The hope is for it to use other data sources in the future. 
Contact me if you'd like to work on it, it needs some fresh eyes and inspiration.
